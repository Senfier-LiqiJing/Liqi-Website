bio: |
  I am currently a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, maintaining a 4.0 GPA. My research centers on **Vision Language Models**, **Generative AI** and **Autonomous Driving**.

  My recent work involves developing StyleVAR, an autoregressive transformer framework for controllable image style transfer. I have also gained industrial research experience at Bosch, where I worked on enhancing VLM grounding capabilities using **Reinforcement Learning (GRPO)** and data distillation.

  Beyond the algorithms, I am an audiophile and a gamer. I enjoy the engineering challenge of building Hi-Res audio systems from scratch—pursuing high fidelity in sound just as I pursue precision in model generation.
